## 📊 What It Does

This project transforms Amazon order invoice PDFs into actionable business insights through a two-part workflow:

### 1. PDF Invoice Extractor (Python Scripts)
Processes Amazon invoice PDFs in batch and extracts structured data including:
- Order Number, Invoice Number, Invoice Value
- Product Description, HSN Code, ASIN, SKU
- Payment Details (Transaction ID, Mode, Date & Time)
- Shipping Address and Place of Delivery

### 2. Analytics Dashboard (Web App)
Upload the extracted CSV to visualize:
- **Overview Metrics**: Total orders, revenue, data quality
- **Geographic Analysis**: State-wise revenue with interactive charts (Bar/Pie/Treemap)
- **Temporal Trends**: Monthly order volume and revenue tracking
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Powered by Plotly with hover, zoom, and pan controls

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Extract Invoice Data

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. For a **single PDF**:
```bash

## 📈 Profit & Shipping Calculation Logic

The dashboard implements a sophisticated profitability engine. Profit is calculated using the following primary formula:

```text
Profit = Total Revenue - (Total Base Costs + Dynamic Shipping Cost)
```

### 1. How Each Variable is Computed

#### **A. Total Revenue**
Revenue is calculated based on the **Selling Price (SP) before GST** for all products identified in the order description, multiplied by the quantity.
*   **Formula**: `(Sum of Unit SP before GST) * Quantity (Qty)`
*   **Source**: SP values are retrieved from the internal master data based on product name matching.

#### **B. Total Base Costs**
This includes all fixed costs associated with the physical product and the sale transaction.
*   **Formula**: `(Purchase Cost + Referral Fee + Packing Cost) * Quantity (Qty)`
*   **Components**: 
    *   **Purchase Cost**: The cost at which the item was bought/manufactured.
    *   **Referral Fee**: Marketplace commission (e.g., Amazon referral fees).
    *   **Packing Cost**: Cost of materials and labor for packaging.

#### **C. Dynamic Shipping Cost**
Shipping is **not** a simple flat fee per item. It is calculated dynamically based on the **Total Weight** of the entire order.
*   **Weight Extraction**: The system scans product descriptions for weight markers (e.g., `1kg`, `500g`).
*   **Total weight**: `Unit Weight * Quantity (Qty)`.
*   **Shipping Tiers**:
    | Total Order Weight | Shipping Cost | Calculation Logic |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **0 - 500g** | ₹76 | Flat rate |
    | **500g - 1kg** | ₹100 | Flat rate |
    | **1kg - 2kg** | ₹143 | Flat rate |
    | **2kg - 5kg** | ₹143 + (₹40/kg) | `143 + ceil(Weight - 2.0) * 40` |
    | **Above 5kg** | ₹263 + (₹26/kg) | `263 + ceil(Weight - 5.0) * 26` |

### 2. Practical Example

Let's calculate the profit for an order of **2 units** of **"Amudham Naturals Raw Peanuts, 1kg Pack"**.

**1. Product Data (per unit):**
- **SP before GST**: ₹286
- **Purchase Cost**: ₹130
- **Referral Fee**: ₹7.08
- **Packing Cost**: ₹20
- **Unit Weight**: 1.0 kg

**2. Variable Calculations:**
- **Total Revenue**: `₹286 * 2` = **₹572.00**
- **Total Base Costs**: `(₹130 + ₹7.08 + ₹20) * 2` = `₹157.08 * 2` = **₹314.16**
- **Total Weight**: `1.0kg * 2` = **2.0 kg**
- **Dynamic Shipping Cost**: (For 2.0kg tier) = **₹143.00**

**3. Final Profit Calculation:**
- `Profit = ₹572.00 - (₹314.16 + ₹143.00)`
- `Profit = ₹572.00 - ₹457.16`
- **Resulting Profit = ₹114.84**

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Extraction Scripts

**Change PDF directory** (in `extract_invoice_batch.py`):
```python
directory_path = "/path/to/your/invoices"
```

**Change page number** (default is page 2):
```python
page_number = 2  # Adjust as needed
```

**Enable debug mode**:
```python
debug_mode = True  # Shows raw text and extraction details
```

### Dashboard

The dashboard automatically processes uploaded CSV files. Configuration is handled via `.streamlit/config.toml` for theme settings.

## 📊 Use Cases

Perfect for Amazon sellers and business analysts who need to:
- Track sales performance across different states/regions
- Identify seasonal trends in orders
- Monitor revenue growth month-over-month
- Analyze product performance by ASIN/SKU
- Generate reports for accounting and tax purposes
- Make data-driven inventory and marketing decisions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extraction Issues

**Fields not extracting?**
1. Enable debug mode: `debug_mode = True`
2. Check the "RAW TEXT FROM PAGE" output
3. Verify the page number (default is page 2)
4. Adjust regex patterns if your PDF format differs

**Description incomplete?**
- The extractor is optimized for Amazon's table format
- Check the "DESCRIPTION EXTRACTION DEBUG" section
- Modify `stop_keywords` if needed

**Scanned/Image PDFs?**
- PyMuPDF only works with text-based PDFs
- For scanned PDFs, you'll need OCR (pytesseract)

### Dashboard Issues

**CSV upload fails?**
- Ensure CSV has the expected column names
- Check that dates are in DD.MM.YYYY format
- Verify Invoice Value is numeric (no currency symbols in the CSV)

## 📦 Dependencies

**Extraction Scripts:**
- PyMuPDF >= 1.23.0 (PDF text extraction)
- Standard library: csv, re, os, glob

**Analytics Dashboard:**
- streamlit >= 1.41.0
- pandas >= 2.1.0
- plotly >= 5.18.0
- matplotlib >= 3.8.0
