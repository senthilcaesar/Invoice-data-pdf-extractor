## 📊 What It Does

This project transforms Amazon order invoice PDFs into actionable business insights through a two-part workflow:

### 1. PDF Invoice Extractor (Python Scripts)
Processes Amazon invoice PDFs in batch and extracts structured data including:
- Order Number, Invoice Number, Invoice Value

- Shipping Address and Place of Delivery

### 2. Analytics Dashboard (Web App)
Upload the extracted CSV to visualize:
- **Overview Metrics**: Total orders, revenue, data quality

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Extraction Scripts

**Change PDF directory** (in `extract_invoice_batch.py`):
```python
directory_path = "/path/to/your/invoices"
```

**Change page number** (default is page 2):
```python
page_number = 2  # Adjust as needed
```

**Enable debug mode**:
```python
debug_mode = True  # Shows raw text and extraction details
```

### Dashboard

The dashboard automatically processes uploaded CSV files. Configuration is handled via `.streamlit/config.toml` for theme settings.

## 📊 Use Cases

Perfect for Amazon sellers and business analysts who need to:
- Track sales performance across different states/regions
- Identify seasonal trends in orders
- Monitor revenue growth month-over-month
- Analyze product performance by ASIN/SKU
- Generate reports for accounting and tax purposes
- Make data-driven inventory and marketing decisions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extraction Issues

**Fields not extracting?**
1. Enable debug mode: `debug_mode = True`
2. Check the "RAW TEXT FROM PAGE" output
3. Verify the page number (default is page 2)
4. Adjust regex patterns if your PDF format differs

**Description incomplete?**
- The extractor is optimized for Amazon's table format
- Check the "DESCRIPTION EXTRACTION DEBUG" section
- Modify `stop_keywords` if needed

**Scanned/Image PDFs?**
- PyMuPDF only works with text-based PDFs
- For scanned PDFs, you'll need OCR (pytesseract)

### Dashboard Issues

**CSV upload fails?**
- Ensure CSV has the expected column names
- Check that dates are in DD.MM.YYYY format
- Verify Invoice Value is numeric (no currency symbols in the CSV)

## 📦 Dependencies

- PyMuPDF >= 1.23.0 (PDF text extraction)
- Standard library: csv, re, os, glob

**Analytics Dashboard:**
