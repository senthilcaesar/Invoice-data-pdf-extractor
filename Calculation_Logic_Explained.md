# Understanding Your Business Analytics

This document explains the logic used to calculate your business performance. Our goal is to provide a clear picture of your cash flow: what you spend, what intermediaries take, and what you actually keep.

## 1. The Three Main Buckets

We break down every sale into three distinct parts:

### 🛍️ Expenses (Your Physical Costs)
This is your **"Out-of-Pocket"** spending. It represents the money you spent to have the product ready for sale.
*   **Included:** Purchase Price of the item + Cost of Packing Materials.
*   **Simple Meaning:** *"This is the money I risked to buy and pack the product."*

### 📦 Platform Fees (Middleman & Govt Take)
This is the **"Deduction"** bucket. It represents every rupee that is taken before the money reaches your bank account.
*   **Included:** Amazon Referral Fees + Shipping Charges + GST (Tax).
*   **Simple Meaning:** *"This is the money that Amazon and the Government keep. I never actually touch this money."*

### 💵 Net Profit (Your Take-Home Pay)
This is your **"Actual Earning."** This is the most honest look at your profit.
*   **Calculation:** Total Customer Payment - Expenses - Platform Fees.
*   **Simple Meaning:** *"This is the actual amount of money that stays in my pocket after everyone else has been paid."*

## 2. The Golden Rule

Every single invoice follows this simple balance:

> **Total Revenue (What the Customer Paid)** 
> **=** 
> **Expenses** + **Platform Fees** + **Net Profit**

## 3. A Concrete Example

Imagine you sell a product where the customer pays **₹1,000** total.

1.  **Preparation (Expenses):**
    *   You bought the item for ₹400.
    *   Packing cost was ₹50.
    *   **Total Expenses = ₹450**

2.  **The Middlemen (Platform Fees):**
    *   Amazon Referral Fee: ₹100
    *   Shipping Charge: ₹80
    *   GST (Tax): ₹120
    *   **Total Platform Fees = ₹300**

3.  **Your Result (Net Profit):**
    *   ₹1,000 (Revenue) - ₹450 (Expenses) - ₹300 (Fees)
    *   **Net Profit = ₹250**

## 4. Why Use This Logic?

*   **Honest Profit:** By including Tax in the "Fees" bucket, you ensure your profit isn't "inflated" by money that actually belongs to the government.
*   **Cash Flow Clarity:** It separates "Physical Costs" (what you control) from "Platform Costs" (what the marketplace controls).
*   **Standardized:** This follows e-commerce best practices to ensure you are never surprised by "hidden" costs.
